# A Linear Regression on Global Suicide Rates and Country Income, Region, Age, and Sex in 2019

## Overview

This repo provides a correlation between global suicide rates and its correlation to country income, region, age, and gender in 2019. Suicide has become a main cause of death globally over the past decades. This creates curiosity in what immutable factors may be affecting suicide rates. This paper looks into the regression between global suicide rates and sex, age, country income, and region. Our results show that there is a weak correlation to age and region/country income affect suicide rates more. Then further analysis is done by studying what factors generate such tendencies.
